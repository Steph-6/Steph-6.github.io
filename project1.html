    <p>The first project was made in week 2 of the immersive course and was built with HTML, CSS and Javascript/jQuery.
    <br />Forest Floor is a calming and fun game in which the player has to catch falling leaves with their mouse, whilst also avoiding falling bombs.</p>
    The Game can be played here: <a href="https://afternoon-journey-42512.herokuapp.com/">Forest Floor</a>
