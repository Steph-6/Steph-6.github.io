###### [](#header-6)After completing a degree in Statistics and Finance at LSE I realised how much I missed using creativity in my work. I had always been artistic but the logical and mathematical side of me led me towards my degree.
  During my course, I experimented using R for Statistical Modelling and played around with Java. I knew I had found my perfect fit. Coding gave me the ability to use logical thinking in my work, whilst still using my creative side to build visually beautiful, yet functional experiences for my peers. For these reasons I knew being a developer would be the perfect fit for my personality, mindset and capability.
