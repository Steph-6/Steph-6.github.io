    <p>For my initial concept I knew I wanted to explore the relationships that can be created with Ruby on Rails - so at least three models. I wanted to create a social network between bars and musicians to make small venues and bars more accessible to unsigned artists.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As a Venue Manager the user can add an Event with a number of slots available. Each slot can then be requested by a registered Musician. The Venue Manager can then accept or reject that pending request.</p>
    The application can be used here: <a href="https://client-thingy.herokuapp.com/">VeNew</a>
